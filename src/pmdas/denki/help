@ 156.0 denki.rapl.rate computed consumption of rapl components
Current electrical power consumption of x86 cpu components.
The rapl cores offered by the system are available as metric
instances.

@ 156.1 denki.rapl.raw rapl reported counters
Raw rapl values as reported by x86 cpus.  These allow to
compute power consumption of longer running compute loads, with
higher accuracy.

@ 156.2 denki.bat.energy_now_raw battery reported charge level
The current charge level as reported by the battery.  This can
be used to calculate overall power consumption of longer running
compute loads, with high accuracy.

@ 156.3 denki.bat.energy_now_rate calculated energy consumption 
Systems current energy consumption, calculated by pmda-denki
from battery charge level.  Only available while discharging.  
Computed every 60 seconds.

@ 156.4 denki.bat.power_now system calculated energy consumption
Systems current energy consumption, calculated by the system.
Only available while discharging, or charging the battery.

@ 156.5 denki.bat.capacity system calculated capacity
Battery capacity, calculated by the driver.
