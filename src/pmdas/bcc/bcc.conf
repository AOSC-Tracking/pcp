# NB. Since all the modules are part of the same process, modules may
# not attach to the same kprobes as others or latter ones will fail -
# this is fixed starting with Linux kernel 4.17 / bcc 0.6.0 releases.

# NB. Cluster IDs 0-99 are reserved for modules which have a related
# tool available as part of BCC. Cluster IDs 100-199 are reserved for
# custom modules developed specifically for PCP BCC PMDA. Cluster IDs
# 200-299 are reserved for possible site-local modules.
