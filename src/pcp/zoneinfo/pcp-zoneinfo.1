.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pcp-zoneinfo
command is used for viewing the different kinds of stats related to numa nodes.
Using various options it helps a user to analyze useful information related to
the zone availability for different numa nodes.This file display information about memory zones.
This is useful for analyzing virtual memory behavior.By default
.B pcp-zoneinfo
reports live data for the local host.

The statistics shown are as follows:

                        scheduling efficiency and reclaim success).

.SH NOTES
.B pcp-zoneinfo
collects information from
.BR /proc/zoneinfo
and aims to be command line and output compatible with it.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
.PP
For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see \fBpmGetOptions\fP(3).
