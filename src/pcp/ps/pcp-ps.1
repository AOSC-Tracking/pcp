.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pcp-ps
command is used for monitoring individual process running on the system.
Using various options it helps a user to see useful information related to
the processes.
This information includes CPU percentage, memory and stack usage,
scheduling and priority.
By default
.B pcp-ps
reports live data for the local host.
.SH OPTIONS
When invoked via the
.BR pcp (1)
command, the
.BR \-h /\c
.BR \-\-host ,
.BR \-O /\c
.BR \-\-origin ,
.BR \-t /\c
.BR \-\-interval ,
.BR \-Z /\c
.BR \-\-timezone
and several other
.I pcp options
become indirectly available; refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for a complete description of these options.
.PP
The additional command line options available for
.B pcp-ps
are:
.TP 5
.BR \-e \fR
Display all the process.

PID
       Process idenfier.

TTY
       The termianl assoicated with the prcoess.

TIME

CMD
       The command name of the task.
.TP
.B \-c [\fIcommand name\fR]
Display the real Command name of the tasks being monitored instead of the UID.
If \fIcommand name\fR is specified, then only tasks belonging to the specified
command are displayed.
.TP
.BR \-U \ [\fIusername\fR] ", " \fB\-\-user\-name\fR[=\fIusername\fR]

If \fIusername\fR is specified, then only tasks belonging to the specified
user are displayed.
.TP

.SH "STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS"
Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the output
format (e.g. with option
.BR \-o )
or to sort the selected processes

For example:
.B ps \-o pid,\:user,\:args

.TS
expand;
lB1 lB1 lBw(\n[ColSize]n)
lB1 l1  l.
\fBCODE       HEADER        DESCRIPTION\fR
.br
\fBpid        PID           a number representing the process ID\fR
.br
\fB%cpu       %CPU          cpu utilization of the process in "##.#" format.
                         Currently, it is the CPU time used divided by the time the
                         process has been running (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as a percentage.\fR
.br
\fB%mem       %MEM          ratio of the process's resident set size  to the physical memory on the
                         machine, expressed as a percentage.\fR
.br
\fBargs       COMMAND       Command with all its arguments as a string. Modifications to the arguments
                         may be shown.  The output in this column may contain spaces.  A process
                         marked <defunct> is partly dead, waiting to be fully destroyed by its parent.
                         Sometimes the process args will be unavailable; when this happens,will instead print the executable name in brackets.\fR
.br
\fBclass      CLS           scheduling class of the process.

                           Field's possible values are:

.br
\fBvsz        VSZ           virtual memory size of the process in KiB (1024\-byte units).Device mappings are currently excluded; this is subject to change.
.br
\fBeuser      EUSER         effective user name.  This will be the textual user ID, if it can be obtained and the field width permits, or a decimal representation otherwise.

.TE

.BR All \fR
       ALL option shows USER,PID,PPID,PRI,%CPU,%MEM,VSZ,RSS,S,STARTED,TIME,WCHAN and Command by default
.TP
.BR \-Z \ \fItimezone\fR ", "\fB\-\-timezone=\fItimezone\fR
By default,
.B pcp-ps
reports the time of day according to the local timezone on the system where
.B pcp-ps
is run.
The
.B \-Z
option changes the timezone to
.I timezone
in the format of the environment variable
.B TZ
as described in
.BR environ (7).
.TP
.BR \-z " , " \fB\-\-hostzone\fR
Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the host that is
the source of the performance metrics.
When replaying a PCP archive that was captured in a foreign timezone, the
.B \-z
option would almost always be used (the default reporting timezone is the
local timezone, which may not be the same as the timezone of the PCP archive).
.TP
.BR \-? " , " \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage message and exit.
.SH NOTES
.B pcp-ps
is inspired by the
.BR ps (1)
command and aims to be command line and output compatible with it.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
.PP
For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see \fBpmGetOptions\fP(3).
